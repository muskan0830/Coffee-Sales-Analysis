# Coffee-Sales-Analysis || Excel

## Objective

The goal of this Excel project is to analyze coffee sales data from a dataset sourced from Kaggle. We will employ essential data analysis techniques to identify key insights and create an interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of coffee sales.

## Introduction

The dataset used in this project consists of three tables: the Order table, which contains information about orders, the Customer table, which provides customer details, and the Product table, which offers product information. This data analyst project focuses on analyzing coffee sales data to gain valuable insights.

## Key Concepts and Techniques

### 1. Data Cleaning

The project begins with data cleaning, which involves checking for missing values, handling duplicates, and adjusting column data types. This step ensures that the data is ready for analysis.

### 2. Data Retrieval and Transformation

The Order table serves as the base table. Data from the Customer and Product tables is retrieved and transformed using Excel functions such as XLOOKUP, IF, INDEX, MATCH, and others. This process enriches the order data with customer and product information.

### 3. Pivot Tables

Pivot tables are created to summarize and aggregate data, enabling analysis of the top 5 customers, total sales over time, and sales by country. These tables are essential for quick data exploration.

### 4. Data Visualization

Multiple charts are utilized for data visualization, including:

- Line chart: Depicting total sales over time.
- Bar chart: Representing sales by country and the top 5 customers.
- Slicers: Used to filter data by roast type, size, and loyalty card, enhancing interactivity.
- Timeline: Inserted to navigate data by months and years.

### 5. Interactive Dashboard

All of the above elements are combined to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard provides a dynamic and user-friendly platform for exploring coffee sales data.

## Key Insights

The project's key insights will include:

- Understanding sales trends over time, which helps in planning inventory and promotions.
- Identifying the top customers, allowing personalized marketing efforts.
- Analyzing the geographical distribution of sales for potential expansion.
